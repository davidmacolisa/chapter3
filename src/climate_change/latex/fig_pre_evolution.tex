        {NOTES: This figure is obtained from estimating this equation $y_{cp,t} = \sum_{t = 2011}^{2013} \beta (Treated \cdot B)_{s,t} + \lambda_{t} + \Phi_{cp} + \zeta_{cp,t} + \epsilon_{cp,t}$. Where $y_{cp,t}$ is the vector of observables. Treated is the grouping variable that is unity for the treated states and zero for the control states. $B_{t}$ is a dummy variable with three levels of time, $2011$, $2012$, and $2013$. $\beta$ is the parameter vector of coefficients. $\lambda_{t}$ is the year fixed effects; $\Phi_{cp}$ is the border-county pair fixed effects; and $\zeta_{cp,t}$ is the border-county-pair-year fixed effects. $\epsilon_{cp,t}$ is the error term. Robust standard errors are clustered at the state level. \par}
