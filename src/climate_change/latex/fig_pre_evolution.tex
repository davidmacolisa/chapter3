        {NOTES: This figure is obtained from estimating this equation $y_{c,t} = \sum_{t = 2011}^{2013} \beta_{c,t} (Treated \cdot B)_{s,t} + \lambda_{t} + \Phi_{c,p} + \zeta_{cp,t} + \epsilon_{c,t}$. Where $y_{c,t}$ is the vector of observables. Treated is the grouping variable that is unity for the treated states and zero for the control states. $B_{t}$ is a dummy variable with three levels of time, $2011$, $2012$, and $2013$. $\beta_{c,t}$ is the parameter vector of coefficients. $\lambda_{t}$ is the year fixed effects; $\Phi_{cp}$ is the border-county pair fixed effects; and $\zeta_{cp,t}$ is the border-county-pair-year fixed effects. $\epsilon_{c,t}$ is the error term. Robust standard errors are clustered at the state level. Row one shows the plots for the county level regressions and row two shows the plots for the state level regressions. \par}
