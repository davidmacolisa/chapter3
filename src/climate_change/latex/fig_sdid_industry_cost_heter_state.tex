        \tiny NOTES: The event study model of equation~\ref{eq:baseline-wages} is $C_{i,sp,t} = \sum_{{e = -3},{e \neq -1}}^{3} \beta (Treated^{e} \cdot D)_{i,s,t} + \psi (Treated^{e})_{s,t} + \vartheta (Treated \cdot D)_{i,s,t} + \mu (Post \cdot D)_{i,s,t} + \tau Treated_{s,t} + \rho D_{i,s,t} + \alpha Post_{t} + \delta X_{v,s,t-1} + \omega F_{f,t} + \lambda_{t} + \sigma_{s} + \phi_{sp} + \zeta_{sp,t} + \epsilon_{i,sp,t}$. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. $D_{i,s,t}$ is unity for low-skilled and zero for high-skilled workers; $Treated_{s,t}$ is unity for treated and zero for control states; and $Post_{t}$ is unity for post-treatment and zero for pre-treatment periods.
